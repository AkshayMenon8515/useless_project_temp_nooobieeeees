### Project Description
This project is a **Shape Accuracy Drawing Game** where players try to draw a circle, rectangle, or triangle as precisely as possible. The system scores the drawing based on accuracy, shows a visual comparison with the ideal shape, and stores high scores using a Flask + SQLite backend.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People around the world are struggling because they can‚Äôt measure how accurately they can draw shapes with a mouse or touchpad, leaving countless circles lopsided and rectangles tragically skewed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is **Cursor Crafter** ‚Äî a fun, interactive game that challenges players to draw perfect shapes, instantly scores their accuracy, and saves results, ensuring no circle, rectangle, or triangle ever suffers from uneven edges again.


## Technical Details
