# Cursor Crafter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: 


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Amal N V - SCMS School Of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
This project is a **Shape Accuracy Drawing Game** where players try to draw a circle, rectangle, or triangle as precisely as possible. The system scores the drawing based on accuracy, shows a visual comparison with the ideal shape, and stores high scores using a Flask + SQLite backend.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People around the world are struggling because they can‚Äôt measure how accurately they can draw shapes with a mouse or touchpad, leaving countless circles lopsided and rectangles tragically skewed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is **Cursor Crafter** ‚Äî a fun, interactive game that challenges players to draw perfect shapes, instantly scores their accuracy, and saves results, ensuring no circle, rectangle, or triangle ever suffers from uneven edges again.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML ‚Äì for structuring the game interface
  CSS ‚Äì for styling and layout design
  JavaScript ‚Äì for drawing logic, scoring system, and canvas interactions
  Python (Flask) ‚Äì for backend server and API handling
  SQL (SQLite) ‚Äì for storing player scores

- Frameworks used
  Flask ‚Äì Python web framework for backend and API routes

- Libraries used
  SQLite3 ‚Äì for database operations in Python
  Time (Python standard library) ‚Äì for timestamp handling
  OS (Python standard library) ‚Äì for file and path handling
  JSON (built-in via Flask) ‚Äì for request/response data formatting

- Tools used
  Visual Studio Code‚Äì for coding and project development
  Web Browser (e.g., Chrome/Firefox) ‚Äì for running and testing the game
  SQLite Database Browser / DB Browser for SQLite ‚Äì for viewing and managing stored scores
  Flask Development Server ‚Äì for running the backend locally
